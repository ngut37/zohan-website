# Getting started

Follow these steps to install necessary packages and to run the application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [git-cz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-cz) - optional, but recommended for commit messages

## Installation

0. (optional) cloning the repository run (alternatively download from GitHub repository)

```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ngut37/zohan-website
```

1. installing dependencies

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install
```

2. running the application

```bash
# to run in watched development mode
$ yarn dev

# to run in build mode
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

## Environment variables

These variables are necessary for the application to run. They can be set up in two ways:

### Set up .env.local

To set up environment variables, create a `.env.local` by copying the `.env.local.example` file and fill in the values.

### Set by environment variables (injected from `process.env`)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` - application environment (`production`, `preview`, `development`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` - secret used for signing JWT tokens on the API
  - this will be removed after auth mini-overhaul (see [Jira - ZOH-128](https://zohan-app.atlassian.net/browse/ZOH-128))
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ID` - The client ID from Google used in OAuth for authentication. Ensure this is set to facilitate Google logins.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SECRET` - The client secret from Google, paired with the client ID to secure OAuth flows.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` - Facebook application client ID for integrating Facebook OAuth.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` - The secret associated with the Facebook client ID for secure OAuth transactions.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - URL of the API (make sure it ends with a `/`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - URL of the application (make sure ends with a `/`)

_📌 note: `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is necessary for the environment variables to be injected into the application, this also makes them accessible on client-side.\_

### Hardcoded values (found in `src/config/config.ts`)

- `MIN_NAME_LENGTH` - minimum length of the staff and company names (number should be lower or equal to `MAX_NAME_LENGTH`)
- `MAX_NAME_LENGTH` - maximum length of the staff and company names (number should be higher or equal to `MIN_NAME_LENGTH`)
- `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH` - minimum length of the password
- `MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH` - maximum length of the password

### Changing environment variables

To change the environment variables, you can either change the `.env.local` file or set the environment variables directly in the terminal. For changes in production, make sure to edit the Vercel application settings.

In case you need to change hardcoded values lets say `SERVICE_LENGTH_CHUNK_SIZE_IN_MINUTES`, change the value in `src/config/config.ts` from e.g. `15` to `30`. Then push to the `master` branch and deploy the application.

# API

Backend API repository can be found on [Github - ngut37/zohan-services](https://github.com/ngut37/zohan-services).

# Available scripts

Refer to `package.json` for content of the scripts.

- `yarn dev` - runs the application in watched development mode
- `yarn build` - builds the application for production usage (artifact is stored in `src/.next` directory)
- `yarn start` - runs the application in production mode from the `src/.next` directory
- `yarn lint` - runs eslint on the `src` directory
- `yarn lint-fix` - runs eslint on the `src` directory and fixes auto-fixable the errors

# Delivery flow

Project's kanban board is available on [Jira - ZOH project](https://zohan-app.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/ZOH/boards/1).

1. create an issue in Jira with `FE` tag
2. create a branch from `master` branch with name `ZOH-<issue number>/<short description>` (e.g. `ZOH-12/fixing-login-page`)
3. move Jira task to `In progress` column
4. create a pull request to `master` branch
5. assign the pull request to someone for review
6. make sure to follow [conventional commit specifications](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when naming the first commit
7. after the PR approval, (squash and) merge the pull request to `master` branch
8. make sure only one commit is merged to `master` branch
9. move Jira task to `Done` column

_📌 note: try not to push or force-push directly to `master` branch as changes details can get lost_
